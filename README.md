## `main.py` is the source code for the desktop (i.e., GUI) version. It is provided for compliance with the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The code in `non_gui_main.py` / `non_gui_main.pyw` allows you to:
1. Never appear **Away** (i.e., always **Available** or **Active**) in communication software such as [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Slack](https://slack.com/)
2. Keep your computer unlocked (i.e., you won't be logged out of Windows when you, for example, walk away from your computer for 30 minutes)

## Should I use `non_gui_main.py` or `non_gui_main.pyw`?

* `non_gui_main.py` is intended to be run in an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or via a [batch file](https://datatofish.com/batch-python-script/). This requires a window to be displayed on your computer (i.e., either the IDE's window or the console's window). This isn't particularly stealthy, as someone may notice that you're running a program (this may not be something you want others to know).
* `non_gui_main.pyw` is intended to be run in the background, without a window. This allows for stealthy usage of the script. To stop the script, you will need to open *Task Manager* and end the *Python* task. See the screenshots below for clarification.
