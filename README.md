# Always Available at Work
The code in `main.py` allows you to:
1. Never appear **Away** (i.e., always **Available** or **Active**) in communication software such as [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Slack](https://slack.com/)
2. Keep your computer unlocked (i.e., you won't be logged out of Windows when you, for example, walk away from your computer for 30 minutes)
